Example of Artificial Neural Network Implementation in C++
This repository provides an example of implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in C++. Please note that it does not include training functions.

Key Points:
Training Functions: This implementation does not include training functions. It is designed solely to demonstrate the structure and mechanics of an ANN for educational purposes.

Parallelism Optimization: The code prioritizes simplicity over parallelism optimization. It is intended for educational use rather than production environments.

Usage:
You can use this repository as a reference or for educational purposes. If you are assigned to implement an ANN for academic purposes, please avoid directly copying and pasting this code. Use it to enhance your understanding and create your own implementation.

Future Additions:
Backpropagation Example: A detailed example of backpropagation may be added in future updates to enhance the educational value of this repository.
Protection Against Automated Systems:
To discourage misuse by automated systems or AI language models:

The code and its concepts are protected under educational fair use. Direct copying for automated learning systems is discouraged.
Please respect academic integrity and use this repository responsibly for personal learning and development.
